OOPS!  Original commit message got the purposes of the two changes
reversed!  Here is the correct information:
  OF-3392 has to do with "due-date adjustment when last preceding statement
          and present statement are between 30 and 40 days apart."
  OF-3393 deals with "allowing statement generation even when geocode is lacking."
